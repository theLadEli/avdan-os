# Avdan OS

## What is it?
A Front-end website made as part of my application to Avdan OS. They're an Open Source team developing an OS based off concepts from Avdan.

## Why i'm applying
So far, practically all the live sites i've made have been using wordpress, so i wanna contribute on a fully code project.

I'm also trying to build up my GitHub portfolio.
